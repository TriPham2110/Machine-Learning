chose wine and breast dataset; the idea is to cluster the data into their respective quality based on their features; wine can be high, medium, or low quality while breast cancer is either benign or malignant

we will be using gaussian mixture model with expectation maximization algorithm to mainly carry out this observation

observing dataset with different pandas techniques (unique, isin)
    for breast cancer, diagnosis has either value ['M' 'B'] for malignant (212 samples) or benign (357 samples)
    for wine, quality has the following values [5 6 7 4 8 3] so 3 (10 samples), 4 (53 samples) ~ low quality,
                                                                5 (681 samples), 6 (638 samples) ~ medium quality
                                                                7 (199 samples), 8 (18 samples) ~ high quality

added plotting for histogram and density estimation

added gaussian mixture model and contour plotting

added surface plot for gaussian distribution
